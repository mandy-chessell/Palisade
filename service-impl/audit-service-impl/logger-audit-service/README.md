# Logger Audit Service

A simple implementation of an Audit Service that simply constructs a message and logs it using log4j.

- Messages are logged at INFO logging level.
- Error messages are logged at ERROR logging level.

An example message is:

```
'Alice' accessed 'file1' for 'Payroll' and it was processed using 'Age off and visibility filtering'
```
